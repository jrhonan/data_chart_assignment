            <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic forced New Yorkers into their homes, many took up bird watching as a safe hobby to keep from going stir crazy. Urban birders have flocked to Central Park and Prospect Park to catch different birds the average
              New Yorker would normally swiftly pass by while trying to catch the train. </p>

            <p>David Barrett, an investor, has been birding in the city for a decade. He also runs the popular Twitter account Brooklyn Bird Alert. He posts user submitted sightings from the Brooklyn area. Since the pandemic, submissions to his
              account are the highest they’ve ever been since starting the account in 2017. </p>


            <p>“New birders have taken to the scene. People seem to be spending more time in the park, finding birds and taking photographs of them”, says 56-year-old Barrett. “I think this is because more people either are not employed now or have
              taken advantage of the flexibility of working remotely.”</p>

            <p>Prospect park and Central Park are popular birding spots in the city where birders can catch a variety of different birds throughout their migration patterns. The fall migration takes place between the months of August and November.
              Ebird is
              a popular site for birders to log their sightings. The data below compares the number of sightings by users of 11 different breeds at both locations.</p>
